# Restaurant-Page
Restaurant page created with vanilla Javascript & Css, the entire html document was generated using javascript only, the main goal was to practice the dom a little bit.
</br>
In this project:
</br>
I used the webpack for the first time ever.
</br>
I adopted the ES6 Module pattern.
</br>
Wrote a clean code as much as i can.
